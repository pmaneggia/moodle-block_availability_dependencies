# Block availability_dependencies

Add this block to a course to display graphically the dependencies "completion -> availability" condition between activities.

Notice: This plugin does not support any other availability conditions that are not based on the completion of other activities.

The graphical representation of the dependencies is a graph whose nodes are the activities (course modules).

An arrow from activity A to activity B is drawn if there is an availability condition on B that depends on the completion of activity A.

The exact meaning of this dependency will be stated on each iteration of the implementation.
